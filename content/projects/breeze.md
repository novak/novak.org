Breeze was a portfolio project I built back in 2016. This project served to show my mobile development skills in the simplest form. I chose to build a weather app because the data was easily available and it would allow for some dynamic content without building an overly complicated product. I created a minimal application icon and interface design for the project as well.

This project is still available on [GitHub](https://github.com/novak/breeze) but is not actively maintained.
