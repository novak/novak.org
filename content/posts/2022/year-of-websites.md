It might seem unlikely, but I'm still going to post more here.

With the technology world seemingly headed towards a pretty massive correction, I think it is time to reset the thought process behind what we use and how we use it. If history is any indication I think we will find the technology products we use today will be almost entirely different than the ones we will be using in 10 years. Hopefully by that point we will have more open and privacy focused options for the technology in our lives. While on the scale of things it seems rather insignificant, hosting websites and fully controlling the content delivery is a small step towards avoiding hostile takeovers of technology platforms.

I'll utilize this to share out content I find interesting in addition to updates on projects I have coming up. I'm also on mastodon, and Twitter (for the moment).
